Web Science PHD - Adam Procter
==============
Here is my open documentation for the activities I am undertaking on my Web Science PhD. This is a joint PhD with Winchester School of Art (WSA) and the Web Science Doctoral Training Centre (DTC) both at the University of Southampton

Housing my documentation here is an experiment and there maybe elements you disagree with, and that’s fine, there will also be unfinished and uncompleted works. If you have alternative ideas that you feel strongly about I’d really welcome your input, but please engage in a constructive manner. Please use the issues feature to raise concerns, thoughts or just typos! Thanks
